# SittingPostureClassification

This project aims to develop a machine learning algorithm that can classify four different kinds of sitting postures (straight, hunch, slouch, slant). The user will be alerted and informed for the kind of posture they have when he or she is not sitting straight.

## Instructions

To use the program, install the files “Pose Detection Model.ipynb”, "body_language_lr.pkl", and "error.wav" to the same folder.
Run the file "Pose Detection Model.ipynb" on macOS Jupyter Notebook.
A raw webcam feed window should pop up. Sit up straight to avoid the error sound.
